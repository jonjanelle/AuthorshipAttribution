## Characteristics considered:
* Average word length: This is simply the average number of characters per word, calculated after the punctuation has been stripped.
* Type-Token Ratio: the number of different words used in a text divided by the total number of words. It's a measure of how repetitive the vocabulary is. 
* Hapax Legomena Ratio is the ratio of unique words to total words. Unique words appear exactly once in the text.
* Average number of words per sentence.
